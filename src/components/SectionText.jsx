        I am a full-stack web developer with a passion for creating applications
        with engaging and intuitive user interfaces. I have a background in
        nursing, which has fostered my sense of resilience and problem-solving.
        Over time, my interest in programming grew and I decided to pivot into
        the software industry. I have experience working on small projects, both
        as an individual and with others. I hope to leverage my insight and
        skills to build impactful software.

        Aside from programming, I'm interested in filmmaking/photography and
        sports. I'm always learning about cinematography, video editing, and
        composition with the goal of producing my own content in the future.
        When it comes to sports, I'm a big NBA and NFL fan who enjoys learning
        about the strategic and analytic side of sports.

        To create this website, I used HTML5, CSS3, and React. I took the
        opportunity to learn about and implement various web-related features
        including CSS transitions, animations, the Intersection Observer API,
        and the scroll event. I also took the photos! ðŸ“¸
